# Automatic-number-plate-recognition-with-PaddleOCR

This projects focuses on ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) system leveraging image processing techniques, incorporating three OCR (Optical Character Recognition) methods: Paddle OCR, Tesseract OCR, and EasyOCR. The system's objective is to automatically detect and recognize vehicle number plates, facilitating intelligent traffic and vehicle management. 

Key stages of the process include image capture, plate identification, edge detection, character segmentation, and plate character recognition. PaddleOCR, recognized as one of the most recent models, demonstrates superior performance across various conditions, thereby enhancing efficiency in real-world applications.

We have preprocessed the existing dataset and trained the latest version of OCR models to give the best results.
